# tiqr

This repository used to contain all source code for the tiqr project, but is now used for documentation via the [wiki](https://github.com/SURFnet/tiqr/wiki).

All contents of the original tiqr repository (all client and server components) have been moved to separate repositories. You can find them in the https://github.com/surfnet account.

Most notably, these are the repositories for the tiqr clients:
- https://github.com/surfnet/tiqr-client-ios
- https://github.com/surfnet/tiqr-client-android

The PHP library:

- https://github.com/surfnet/tiqr-server-libphp

And the simpleSAMLphp modules:
- https://github.com/surfnet/simplesamlphp-module-authtiqr
- https://github.com/surfnet/simplesamlphp-module-themetiqr
